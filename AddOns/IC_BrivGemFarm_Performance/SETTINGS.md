# BrivGemFarm_Performance Settings File
## Description:
These are the settings used by the BrivGemFarm_Performance AddOn. They are saved in `BrivGemFarmSettings.json` and can be configured through the main Briv Gem Farm tab, the Advanced Settings tab, or edited directly in the JSON file.

## Settings:

* **LastSettingsUsed**: `<string>` (Default: "Default")  
Stores the name of the last settings profile loaded or saved.

* **Fkeys**: `0` / `1` (Default: `1`)  
When set to 1, the script uses function keys (F1-F12) to level up champions in the active team automatically, eliminating the need for familiars on individual bench slots.

* **StackFailRecovery**: `0` / `1` (Default: `1`)  
Enables forced early restarts to recover when Briv runs out of haste stacks but has sufficient Steelbones stacks in reserve to proceed with a new run.

* **DisableDashWait**: `0` / `1` (Default: `0`)  
When set to 1, completely disables waiting for Shandie's Dash to activate after a stack restart.

* **StackZone**: `<integer>` (Default: `700`)  
The zone number after which the script will begin farming Steelbones stacks for Briv (usually positioned a couple of zones prior to the Modron reset zone).

* **MinStackZone**: `<integer>` (Default: `200`)  
The minimum area zone where Briv is allowed to farm Steelbones stacks (used as a fallback recovery limit).

* **TargetStacks**: `<integer>` (Default: `0`)  
The target number of haste stacks that the script should attempt to farm for the next run.

* **RestartStackTime**: `<integer>` (Default: `12000`)  
The time in milliseconds that the client will remain closed during a stack restart (an offline stack restart is disabled if this is set to 0).

* **BuyChests**: `0` / `1` (Default: `1`)  
Enables automatic purchasing of chests.

* **OpenChests**: `0` / `1` (Default: `1`)  
Enables automatic opening of chests.

* **MinGemCount**: `<integer>` (Default: `0`)  
The minimum gem count to maintain. No chests will be purchased if your gem count falls below this threshold.

* **BuyGoldChestRatio** / **BuySilverChestRatio**: `<decimal>` (Default: `1.0` / `0.0`)  
Determines the proportion of chest purchases allocated to gold vs. silver chests. For example, 0.9 for gold and 0.1 for silver means 90% of spent gems buy gold chests and 10% buy silver chests.

* **MinGoldChestCount** / **MinSilverChestCount**: `<integer>` (Default: `0`)  
The number of gold or silver chests to keep in reserve. The script will open chests only above this quantity.

* **WaitToBuyChests**: `0` / `1` (Default: `1`)  
Known in the GUI as "Only buy/open max chests (250 buy/1000 open)". When set to 1, the script waits to buy or open chests until a full/max request size can be sent to reduce server load.

* **FeatSwapEnabled**: `0` / `1` (Default: `0`)  
Enables automatic feat swapping (such as Briv's Steelbones vs. Haste feats) at the appropriate zones (requires supporting addons).

* **HiddenFarmWindow**: `0` / `1` (Default: `0`)  
Hides the secondary command window launched by the script for farming when set to 1. Only a tray icon will be visible.

* **RestoreLastWindowOnGameOpen**: `0` / `1` (Default: `1`)  
When enabled, the script attempts to return focus to the last active window on your computer immediately after launching the game.

* **IgnoreBrivHaste**: `0` / `1` (Default: `0`)  
Known in the GUI as "Predict Stacks Off? (IgnoreBrivHaste)". When set to 1, ignores Briv's haste stacks when predicting/deciding when to stack, forcing offline stacking once per run.

* **FortOnlyRestart**: `0` / `1` (Default: `0`)  
Known in the GUI as "No Stack FORTs". When running Forced Offline restarts, the game will restart instantly rather than farming stacks while offline.

* **WaitForZoneCompleted**: `0` / `1` (Default: `1`)  
Known in the GUI as "Complete Zone Before Stacking". When checked, the script completes the current zone before starting online stacking.

* **ForceOfflineGemThreshold**: `<integer>` (Default: `0`)  
Activates "hybrid stacking" (HTS). Forces the script to perform an offline stack restart once the number of gems earned above your reserve limit reaches this threshold (0 = disable).

* **ForceOfflineRunThreshold**: `<integer>` (Default: `0`)  
Same as `ForceOfflineGemThreshold`, but specified as the number of runs based on "Resets Done" as reported by the current Modron core. An offline stack restart is forced every N runs (0 or 1 = disable). If both run and gem thresholds are set, either reaching its threshold will trigger the stack restart.

* **BrivJumpBuffer**: `<integer>` (Default: `0`)  
The number of areas before the Modron reset zone where the script will switch from the 'q' (jump) formation to the 'e' (non-jump) formation to ensure stacks convert properly.

* **DashWaitBuffer**: `<integer>` (Default: `30`)  
The distance from your Modron's reset zone where dashwait will stop being activated.

* **WindowXPosition** / **WindowYPosition**: `<integer>` (Default: `0` / `0`)  
Sets the horizontal and vertical screen coordinates where the gem farm script window appears on your monitor.

* **WardenUltThreshold** / **FaridehUltThreshold**: `<integer>` (Default: `0`)  
Triggers Warden's or Farideh's ultimates while stacking when the number of enemies exceeds the specified threshold (0 = off).

* **PreferredBrivJumpZones**: `<array>`  
An array of 50 binary values representing the zones in a 50-zone cycle where Briv jumps are preferred (`1` allows jumping, `0` disables).

* **BrivLevelingThresholdsCount**: `<integer>` (Default: `5`)  
Specifies the count of custom zone leveling thresholds for Briv.

* **BrivLevelingThresholds**: `<array>`  
Contains the custom zone and level mapping array (e.g. `[{"zone": 1100, "level": 400}, ...]`) for auto-leveling Briv.
